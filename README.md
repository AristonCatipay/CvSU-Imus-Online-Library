## Introduction

Students and teachers are unable to physically visit the campus library to check out books or read senior theses during a pandemic. We made the decision to build an online library system where students may go through books and see library theses. If they want to borrow a book, they can request it, and if the librarians or staff approve it, they will be given a pickup date. A return date will be provided if the student or instructor picks up the book on the specified date. The transaction is finished after the book is returned, provided that it was done on time. In the event that the book isn't returned, the penalty will be determined based on the time interval between the return date and the pickup date.
